  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/;[17] Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal
    (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल),[18] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in
    the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north,
    and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri
    Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including
    fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including
    Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious
    and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital 
    and the largest city.</p>
